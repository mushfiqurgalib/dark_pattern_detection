We apply for the following three badges:
1. Evaluated - Functional
3. Available

We believe our artifact deserves an "Evaluated - Functional" badge because it is well documented (we specifically describe its contents in the README file), complete, and exercisable (we provide all the artifacts/data/scripts needed to build/run our tool and replicate our tool evaluation). 

Finally, our artifact is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/SageSELab/AidUI) and has been archived on Zenodo.
